# Zentinel - LLM Context File
# This file provides context for AI assistants about Zentinel

> Zentinel is a security-first reverse proxy built on Cloudflare Pingora, designed for production deployments with "sleepable ops" - meaning it's built to minimize operational overhead and avoid 3am wake-up calls.

## About Zentinel

Zentinel is an open-source reverse proxy platform that prioritizes:
- Security-first design with hardened defaults
- High performance using Cloudflare's Pingora framework (Rust)
- Extensibility through external agents (WAF, auth, rate limiting)
- Operational simplicity with bounded resources and deterministic behavior

## Key Features

- **TLS Termination**: Modern TLS 1.2/1.3 with OCSP stapling, SNI support
- **Load Balancing**: 14+ algorithms including Maglev, Peak EWMA, Weighted Least Connections
- **Health Checking**: HTTP, TCP, gRPC health checks with circuit breakers
- **Request Routing**: Path, header, method-based routing with priorities
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-client and global rate limits with multiple backends
- **Caching**: HTTP response caching with Pingora cache infrastructure
- **Compression**: Gzip and Brotli compression
- **GeoIP Filtering**: MaxMind and IP2Location support
- **WebSocket Support**: Full WebSocket proxying
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, structured JSON logging, OpenTelemetry tracing

## Agent Architecture

Zentinel uses external agents for extensibility:
- WAF agents (ModSecurity/Coraza compatible)
- Authentication agents (JWT, OAuth, custom)
- Rate limiting agents
- Custom business logic agents

Agents communicate via Unix sockets, gRPC, or HTTP with timeout and circuit breaker protection.

## Configuration

Zentinel uses KDL (human-friendly document language) for configuration:
- Declarative, Git-friendly format
- Hot reload without restart
- Schema validation with helpful errors
- Multi-file configuration support
- Namespace isolation for multi-tenant deployments
